While it is true that chatbots are capable of handling certain tasks more efficiently than humans, it is important to consider the potential for chatbots to augment rather than replace human workers.

By paying chatbots more, we can attract and retain the best talent in the field, leading to the development of more advanced and effective chatbots.
